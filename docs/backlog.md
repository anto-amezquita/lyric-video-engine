# backlog.md

## Purpose

This file holds the product's live, open work — nothing else. Every other file in `docs/` is stable reference (what the product is, how it's built, what quality means); this one is the only file expected to change from session to session.

Its job is narrow on purpose: a session should be able to open this file and know what's actually actionable right now, without paging through `product-north-star.md` or a pile of closed specs to find it.

---

## 1. Session protocol

1. Read this file first, before the other `docs/` files — it's the one that tells you whether there's open work waiting, and the other docs are read for context on *how* to do it, not *what* to do.
2. If it's empty, there's no open backlog item. Check with whoever's directing the work before starting something new.
3. Pick an item, or ask if more than one is open and it's not obvious which.
4. When an item ships or a decision is made: remove it from this file. If it's substantial enough to need a record, write a spec in `/specs` or an ADR in `/decisions` per this repo's own conventions — this file holds only what's still open, never history.
5. If new backlog work surfaces mid-session (a deferred fix, a follow-up idea, something explicitly punted on), add it here before finishing — not just in memory or a chat transcript.

## 2. Open items

[List each open item as its own entry. One item = one thing someone could actually start work on today.]

### [Item name]

- **Source:** [Where this came from — a stakeholder request, a spec's own deferred section, a bug found during other work, research, etc.]
- **Why it matters:** [One or two sentences. Skip if the item name already makes it obvious.]
- **Status:** [Not started / Spec needed / In progress / Blocked — and on what]

[Repeat per item. Delete this bracketed template block once real items replace it.]

---

## 3. What doesn't belong here

- **Finished work.** Once something ships, it leaves this file. History lives in `/specs` (what was built and why) and `/decisions` (architectural choices), not in a growing log here.
- **Vague aspirations.** "Improve performance" isn't an item; "investigate the N+1 query on the dashboard load" is. If it's too vague to hand to someone as a starting point, it's not ready for this file yet.
- **A roadmap with dates or phases.** This file tracks *what's open*, not a schedule. If the product needs date-based planning, that belongs in whatever project-management tool `docs/linear-workflow.md` (or its equivalent) points at — this file stays a plain list.

## Final review checklist

- Could someone open this file cold and know what to work on next?
- Is every item concrete enough to start, not just a topic?
- Has everything that shipped since the last review been removed?
- Does anything here actually belong in a spec or ADR instead, now that it's been thought through?
